                    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                    <p>We effectively become your tenant, guaranteeing you a fixed rental income. We then sub-let the property, taking great care to select the right tenants and then manage the property throughout the full duration of the tenancy â€“ leaving you to get on with your busy life.</p>
                    <p>We will take care of the Assured short-hold tenancy agreement (AST). If they stop paying, leave without notice, damage the property or force us to take out an eviction order, we will incur this financial burden, not you.</p>
                    <p>guarenteed rent is precisely what it says on the tin; regardless of whether your property is left unoccupied, we'll ensure the agreed rent is paid every month and  may also be able to offer up to 2-months' rent in advance. We are here for you and your tenants 24/7, 365 days of the year so you don't have to worry about anything else. Our hands-on approach will mean your property will be adequately maintained giving you total peace of mind.</p>
