                    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                    <p>We effectively become your tenant, guaranteeing you a fixed rental income and then sub-let the property on an Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST). You will continue to receive the agreed rent regardless of whether the property is empty or the tenant stops paying rent, unless rendered uninhabitable. As such, it is in our interests to find the best possible tenant. We will even deal with damages at the end of the tenancy, subject to a maximum value equivalent to 6 weeks rent. Additionally, our in house legal team will deal with any breaches of the AST at no cost to you.</p>

                    <h2>Is it for me?</h2>
                    <p>Finding the right letting service for you depends on the level of responsibility and risk you are prepared to take. Our Guaranteed Rent service best suits landlords who want the financial stability of knowing what their rental income will be each month, with the benefits of the best property management available.</p>

                <div className="guarenteed-faq-p">
                    <h2>How long is the contract?</h2>
                    <p>Depending on the office, we can offer contract periods from a minimum of 12 months. Contracts can be renewed either on a rolling basis or online.</p>

                <div className="guarenteed-faq-p">
                    <h2>What parts of the country do you cover?</h2>
                    <p>We are a network of individuals from across the UK, and therefore we cover the vast majority of the country. Although, our main area of focus is London &#38; the South East of England. </p>

                <div className="guarenteed-faq-p">
                    <h2>Why should I trust you?</h2>
                    <p>We are one of the leading companies to ever specialise in offering genuine Guaranteed Rent, and we are also a member of the SAFEagent scheme. </p>

                <div className="guarenteed-faq-p">
                    <h2>What about the internal condition of the property?</h2>
                    <p>When we sub-let the property we take the normal deposit from the tenant, which is then registered with one of the approved deposit protection services. When the tenant checks out, the deposit is used to cover the cost of any damages. We guarantee to pay you up to 1.5 times the monthly rent, subject to fair wear and tear, in respect of the condition of the property.</p>

                    <h2>What are the benefits of Guaranteed Rent for landlords?</h2>
                    <p>No void periods, no rent arrears, no commission, no set-up fees, no renewal fees or any other “hidden extras”. No need to deal with the tenants at all. We can be flexible with payment dates, contract lengths, and start dates.</p>
